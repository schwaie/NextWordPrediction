This repository contains the code from the Capstone Project of the Data Science specialization from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

The repository contains the following files:
* `preprocessing.R`: the script for loading and cleaning the sample data
* `PredictNextWord`: the algorithm for predicting the next word
* `dtBigram`: the datatable containing all bigrams, their frequency, the `base` and the `prediction` (last word in string)
* `dtTrigram`: the datatable containing all trigrams, their frequency, the `base` and the `prediction` (last word in string)
* `dtFourgram`: the datatable containing all fourgrams, their frequency, the `base` and the `prediction` (last word in string)
* `dtFivegram`: the datatable containing all fivegrams, their frequency, the `base` and the `prediction` (last word in string)
* `server.R`: the server file for the app
* `UI.R`: the UI file for the app
* `about.md`: the about file contained in the app
